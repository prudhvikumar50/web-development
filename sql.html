      SQL, which stands for <b>Structured Query Language</b>, is a standardized
      language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. Unlike
      general-purpose programming languages like Python or Java, SQL is a
      domain-specific language designed specifically for data management. It's
      the primary way to communicate with a database, allowing you to create,
      retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) data. A key feature of SQL is its
      declarative nature, where you describe what you want to achieve rather
      than how to achieve it. This makes it intuitive for tasks like filtering
      records with a WHERE clause or joining multiple tables using JOIN
      statements. SQL's power lies in its ability to handle massive datasets
      efficiently, making it an indispensable tool for data analysts, database
      administrators, and developers in almost every industry.
