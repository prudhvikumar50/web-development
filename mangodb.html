      MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible,
      document-based format. Unlike traditional SQL databases with rigid,
      tabular schemas, MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) documents,
      which are similar to JSON objects. This schema-less design allows for
      greater flexibility and scalability, making it ideal for managing large
      volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB's document model
      simplifies development by allowing developers to work with data in a
      format that closely matches the objects in their application code. It
      offers powerful querying capabilities, including support for rich, ad-hoc
      queries, indexing, and aggregation pipelines. MongoDB's horizontal
      scalability, achieved through a technique called sharding, allows it to
      distribute data across multiple servers, enabling it to handle massive
      traffic and data growth.
