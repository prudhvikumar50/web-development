      Spring is a popular, open-source Java framework that provides a
      comprehensive platform for building enterprise-level applications. It's
      known for its lightweight and non-invasive approach, and its core
      principle is Inversion of Control (IoC), where the framework manages the
      creation and lifecycle of objects, allowing developers to focus on writing
      business logic. Spring also heavily utilizes Dependency Injection (DI), a
      pattern where components are given their dependencies from an external
      source rather than creating them themselves. The framework's modular
      nature allows developers to use only the parts they need, such as Spring
      Boot, a module that simplifies the configuration and setup of new Spring
      applications, and Spring MVC, for building web applications. Spring's
      robust support for data access, transaction management, and security,
      combined with its massive community and extensive documentation, makes it
      a go-to choice for building complex, scalable, and maintainable
      applications. Its a great example of a framework that addresses complexity
      by providing a structured and well-defined way to build software.
