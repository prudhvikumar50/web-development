      Django is a high-level, open-source Python web framework that enables
      rapid development of secure and scalable web applications. It follows the
      Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which Django itself
      refers to as Model-View-Template (MVT), emphasizing a clear separation of
      concerns. The framework is often described as "batteries-included" because
      it provides a comprehensive set of built-in features, including an ORM
      (Object-Relational Mapper) for database interaction, a powerful admin
      interface that's automatically generated, and a robust URL routing system.
      Django's focus on Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principles and convention
      over configuration streamlines the development process, allowing
      developers to create complex, database-driven websites with significantly
      less code. Its built-in security features, such as protection against
      common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request
      forgery (CSRF), make it a reliable choice for building secure
      applications. Django's large and active community, along with its
      extensive documentation, further solidify its position as one of the most
      popular frameworks for web development.
