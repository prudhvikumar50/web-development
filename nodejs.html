      Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
      that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web
      browser. It's built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that
      powers Google Chrome, making it incredibly fast and efficient. Node.js
      uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it ideal for
      building highly scalable, real-time applications such as chat
      applications, live streaming services, and online games. This model
      handles a large number of concurrent connections with minimal overhead.
      While it is not a programming language itself, it is a powerful
      environment that has made JavaScript a versatile language for both
      client-side and server-side development. This allows developers to use a
      single language for their entire application stack, from the front-end to
      the back-end, which simplifies development and fosters a cohesive team.
      Its extensive package manager, npm (Node Package Manager), offers access
      to a massive ecosystem of libraries and tools, making it easy to add
      functionality and streamline workflows.
